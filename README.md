## hey, i'm dot!
right now i'm working on my first real project: [thelittlethings](https://github.com/dots-git/thelittlethings). it's also the first package i have ever published to pypi. i'm a python developer and would always be making the same utilities for every single project i'd make. therefore i decided to package them up and publish them for everyone to use.

another project i have started work on is [dot-ui](https://github.com/dots-git/dot-ui). it will be using many of the utilities i've made for the thelittlethings project and provide an easy way to create a user interface. i may use it as an opportunity to dive into the world of cpython as i plan on providing custom drawing functions for the ui. one of those is a shadowing method i developed that looks great but is just a little bit too slow in its python implementation.

i am also interested in making my own programming language. i have a few ideas for it but i'm not sure if i'll be able to make it. my ideas included a language that reads like english and uses pattern matching for its syntax. it would look something like this:

```
add up some a, some b, and some c means:
    add up a and b
    add c

add up one, two and three
print the result
```

i believe it would be possible to execute something like this with enough time and skill but as it would be very slow in python i would only make it in C, C++ or Rust, none of which i am very familiar with.
